- Time is provided by a DS3231 "extremely accurate real time clock".
- Date can be modified with two buttons (click once to edit hour, twice for minutes) then use the second button to increase the hours/minutes
- Brightness is measured with a 5628 photo resistor
- Minimal power requirement for the arduino (enter in deep sleep mode after each display)
