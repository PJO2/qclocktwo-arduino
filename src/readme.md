## the arduino source code for a french word clock

Manage a 14x14 led matrix to highlight the leds behind this letter matrix according to the current time.

The clock is provided by a DS3231 unit and a two button interface allow to update the date.

Presently this source will not not produce a 14x14 output but the successive ouptuts of each row of 14 leds, since i have not soldered the led strip...
